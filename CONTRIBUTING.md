# Contributing to mdts

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **mdts**!  
This project aims to be a simple, fast, and useful tool for working with Markdown files â€” especially for those building LLM workflows or documentation pipelines.

All kinds of contributions are welcome: bug reports, ideas, code changes, or even just feedback.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/unhappychoice/mdts.git
cd mdts
npm install
cd packages/frontend
npm install
```

mdts is written in TypeScript. You'll find the source in `src/`, and tests in `test/`.

Handy commands:

### Run 
``` 
npm run dev            # Watch mode for development
npm run start          # Build and run
```

### Test and lint
```
npm run watch          # Run tests and lints automatically
npm run watch:frontend # Run tests and lints automatically
npm run test           # Run tests
npm run test:frontend  # Run frontend tests
npm run lint           # Run lint and format check
npm run lint:frontend  # Run frontend lint and format check
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Issues

- Bug reports are helpful â€” please include reproduction steps if possible.
- Feature suggestions are also welcome, especially if you can describe the use case.

### Pull Requests

Before opening a PR:

- Run lint and tests:

```
npm run lint
npm test
```

- Keep changes minimal and focused. Small, clear PRs are easier to review.
- If you're adding a new feature, try to update the relevant documentation as well.
- English is preferred for code comments, but it's not a strict rule.

### Philosophy

mdts is designed to be:

- Static: input â†’ output with no surprises
- Fast: minimal dependencies, quick execution
- Markdown-first: results should be readable in any Markdown viewer

Weâ€™re not trying to be everything to everyone â€” just a solid CLI tool for working with Markdown and embedded code blocks.
