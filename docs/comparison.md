While most Markdown preview tools focus on rendering single files or flat directories, `mdts` is built for exploring and reviewing **entire documentation projects**. It excels at use cases like:

- Browsing and reviewing a large number of Markdown files
- Hosting project wikis or internal knowledge bases locally
- Previewing document structure before publishing

### ✅ Clean, Focused UI with Extensive Customization
Built with React and modern CSS, `mdts` offers a distraction-free reading experience with comprehensive theming options:

- **Multiple Application Themes**: Choose from 20+ built-in color schemes (Aurora, Ocean, Forest, etc.)
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Seamless switching with system preference detection
- **Syntax Highlighting Themes**: Extensive collection of popular code themes (Atom One Dark, VS Code, GitHub, etc.)
- **Layout Options**: Compact centered or full-width modes for different reading preferences

### ✅ Zero-install via `npx`
You can start using it immediately with a single command:

```
npx mdts
```
