# Markdown Link Samples

This document demonstrates various ways to create links in Markdown.

## 1. Inline Links

This is a [simple inline link](https://www.example.com).

Links can also have a title, which appears on hover:
[Link with Title](https://www.example.com "Example Website")

## 2. Reference-Style Links

Reference-style links make your Markdown cleaner, especially for long URLs.

This is a [reference link][1].
This is [another reference link][google].

[1]: https://www.example.com/page1
[google]: https://www.google.com "Google Search Engine"

You can also use implicit names:
[Implicit Reference Link][]

[Implicit Reference Link]: https://www.example.com/implicit

## 3. Relative Links

Links to other files within the same project.

[Link to another Markdown file](../specs/basic.md)
[Link to a file in a subdirectory](./features/frontmatter.md)

## 4. Absolute Links

Links to external websites.

[GitHub](https://github.com)
[OpenAI](https://openai.com)

## 5. Image Links

Images can also be links. Clicking the image will take you to the specified URL.

[![Alt text for image](../../logo.svg)](../../logo.svg)

## 6. Email Links

Automatically creates a mailto link.

Contact us at: <mailto:info@example.com>
Or simply: info@example.com

## 7. Internal Anchor Links

Links to specific sections within the same document. These require the target section to have an ID, often generated by the Markdown renderer (e.g., from headings).

[Go to Inline Links](#1-inline-links)
[Go to Reference-Style Links](#2-reference-style-links)
[Go to Image Links](#5-image-links)

## 8. Bare URLs

Some Markdown renderers (like GFM) automatically convert bare URLs into clickable links.
